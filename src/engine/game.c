/*

    This files contains 1 function that checks for collisions and another than simply
    draws all the sprites to the screen. 

    Both of these have to be done on every frame (in the "render loop" in main.c).

    Rendering everything to the screen is farily straight forward - we select, or
    "bind" the VBO and VAO that we want to use, the shader program that goes with those
    objects ( you can, and we have, multiple shader programs that do different things), 
    and then tell openGL to draw the sprite.
